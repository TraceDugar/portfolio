I decided to come into software development due to the need for software developers.  I feel as though I can bring some good ideas to the table especially whenever projects involve audio. The ideal environment would be in my at home studio, while doing software development in order to clean up audio if necessary.  I have also studied a bit of design at Loyola, and feel as though this helps whenever I am working on the UI of a page. ‚ú®",
